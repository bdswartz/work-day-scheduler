# Welcome to Work Day Scheduler

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Purpose
This is a scheduler that runs in a browser window.  With this app, the user can plan the current day's work.  The user is able to update the planned task by hour of the day.  The scheduler provides visual indicators by color as the day progresses.  Tasks that are in the past are greyed out where current tasks are presented in red and planned future tasks are presented in green.  When the user click on the save icon, the work plan is saved to local storage so that if the browser window is closed, the tasks persist.  Since not all users work a "9 to 5" schedule, recently added is a feature to allow the user to enter a customized work schedule via a modal form.  As the work day schedule changes the data for that hour, previously saved by the user, stays with that hour.
